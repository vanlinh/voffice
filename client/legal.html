        personal information, such as Your name, physical and email address, and telephone number.<br/><br/>

        (b) IP Information: In general, We collect and use anonymous information and data regarding Your access

        (c) Cookies and Analytical Tracking: Sometimes We use cookie technology, web beacons and other similar
        devices on Our Websites to enhance functionality and navigation for our visitors, and portions of Our
        Websites may use statistical tools that may be operated by third party providers (collectively, the
        “Analytical Tools”). Information tracked through these mechanisms includes, but is not limited
        to:<br/><br/>

        (i) your IP address;<br/>
        (ii) the type of web browser and operating system being used;<br/>
        (iii) the pages of a Websites a user visits; and<br/>
        (iv) other websites a user visited before visiting one of the Websites. If you wish to disable cookies,
        refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. Please note that if you disable
        cookies, you may be unable to access some customized features on the Websites. Cookies do not collect or
        contain your personal information.<br/>
        Internet tags, graphic tags and similar web beacon type functions allow Us to count the number of users
        who have visited a particular web page or to access certain cookies. We may use web beacons on the
        Websites to count users and to recognize users by accessing our cookies. Being able to access our
        cookies allows Us to personalize the Websites and improve your experience at the Websites. We may also
        include web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail messages that We send to determine which e-mail messages
        were opened. Like cookies, web beacons do not collect or contain your personal information.
        <br/><br/>
        In the case of Analytical Tools, the information generated by the cookies and/or web beacons about your

        Tool. This information will be used for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Websites, compiling
        reports on Websites activity and providing other services relating to Websites activity and Internet
        usage. The third party providers of Analytical Tools may also transfer this information to other third
        parties where they are required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on
        their behalf.
